From the Point whre i tried understanding the Neondb architecture to knowing about PITR using WALs

Starting off Postgres is based out of tuple oriented storage, i.e it has a buffer pool which is managed by postgres it self. For every database action may it be read or write it fetches the page where record is present and try checking whether the page is actually present in cache or not. If it is not able to find it will pull it from disk and make an in memory change accordingliy. Along side that all the databases along with postgres maintains WAL for durability purposes. Here the query will be logged and immediatly and flushes from WAL in-memory to WAL on disk (fsync = on | fsync = off)

So going to Neon they try to get rid of this tuple oriented storage, andreplace it with Log structured storage . 

So from my understanding how things work :

1. We have a single primary node (For all the writes) and many read replicas
2. Here the WAL files from the write instances will be moved to safe-keeper, once the safe-keepers (implement consensus) say their majority of nodes have the entry the transaction is marked commited.
3. These safe keeper push the WAL to page servers
4. THese pageservers push data to cloud.
5. page servers acts as the interface for postgres to assume that they are still working with tuple oriented storage whering it implements log structured stirage underneath.
